1. localStorage, sessionStorage
Client storage that allow you to store data on the client side. 
Example: authentication with the server.

2. Hoisting 
The process of copying variable declaration to the top of the scope at runtime. The variable is available but is not yet assigned.
*always prefer to define vars in the top of the scope.
The js file will be after hoisting: vars -> function -> code by order.

3. this
This is called at the time of invocation.
Global this is undefined in "use strict"

4. bind,call and apply
bind: call me later. I can be updated from call to call.
apply: execute me right now; this + individual.
call: execute me rigth now; this + individual parameters.

5. closures: 
A function inside a function that relied on the other function varibales to work. 

6. callback, event loop
callback is function that you pass as an argument to an async function. when the async function finish to run it calls the function we passed. 
setTimeout(function(){}, <duration>) - this is good example to async function. the js will keep running and the function will be execute after <duration>
*Keeo in mind that we cannot control the order of the async function if we need order we will need to put then inside. 
* call back stack-> webApi -> even queue-> stack

7. promises:


8. Functional programming: 



5.go over map,filter, reduse. 
6.go over presantion.
